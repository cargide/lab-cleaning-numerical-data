# Lab | Cleaning numerical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder.

## Context

An auto insurance company has collected some data about its customers including their _demographics_, _education_, _employment_, _policy details_, _vehicle information_ on which insurance policy is, and _claim amounts_. You will help the senior management with some business questions that will help them to better understand their customers, improve their services, and improve profitability.

**Some business Objectives**:

- Retain customers,
- Analyze relevant customer data,
- Develop focused customer retention programs.

Based on the analysis, take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries.

2. Load the we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv into the variable customer_df

3. First look at its main features (head, shape, info).

4. Rename the columns so they follow the PE8 (snake case) (lower_case_with_underscores)

5. Change effective to date column to datetime format.

6. Define a function that differentiates between continuous and discrete variables. Hint: The number of unique values might be useful. Store continuous data into a continuous_df variable and do the same for discrete_df

7. Plot a correlation matrix, comment what you see.

8. Create a function to plot every discrete variable.  Do the same with the continuous variables (Be Careful, you may need to change the plot type to one better suited for continuous data!)

9. Comment what you can see in the plots.

10. Look for outliers in the continuous variables. (HINT: Thereâ€™s a good plot to do that!)

11. Did you find outliers?  Comment what you will do with them.

12. Check all columns for NaN values.  Decide what (if anything) you will need to do with them.

# Lab | Cleaning categorical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder. In this lab we will explore categorical data.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries if you are starting a new notebook.
Using the same data as the previous lab: we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv

2. Find  all of the categorical data.  Save it in a categorical_df variable.

3. Check for NaN values.

4. Check all unique values of columns.

5. Check dtypes. Do they all make sense as categorical data?

6. Does any column contain alpha and numeric data?  Decide how to clean it.

7. Would you choose to do anything else to clean or wrangle the categorical data?  Comment your decisions.

8. Compare policy_type and policy.  What information is contained in these columns.  Can you identify what is important?  

9. Check number of unique values in each column, can they be combined in any way to ease encoding?  Comment your thoughts and make those changes.


# Lab | Feature extraction

For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs. 

### Instructions

1. Open the `categoricals` variable we created before.

```python
categoricals = data.select_dtypes(np.object)
categoricals.head()
```

2. Plot all the categorical variables with the proper plot. What can you see?
3. There might be some columns that seem to be redundant, check their values to be sure. What should we do with them?
4. Plot time variable. Can you extract something from it?
