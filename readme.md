# Lab | Cleaning numerical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder.

## Context

An auto insurance company has collected some data about its customers including their _demographics_, _education_, _employment_, _policy details_, _vehicle information_ on which insurance policy is, and _claim amounts_. You will help the senior management with some business questions that will help them to better understand their customers, improve their services, and improve profitability.

**Some business Objectives**:

- Retain customers,
- Analyze relevant customer data,
- Develop focused customer retention programs.

Based on the analysis, take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries.

2. Load the we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv into the variable customer_df

3. First look at its main features (head, shape, info).

4. Rename the columns so they follow the PE8 (snake case) (lower_case_with_underscores)

5. Change effective to date column to datetime format.

6. Define a function that differentiates between continuous and discrete variables. Hint: The number of unique values might be useful. Store continuous data into a continuous_df variable and do the same for discrete_df

7. Plot a correlation matrix, comment what you see.

8. Create a function to plot every discrete variable.  Do the same with the continuous variables (Be Careful, you may need to change the plot type to one better suited for continuous data!)

9. Comment what you can see in the plots.

10. Look for outliers in the continuous variables. (HINT: Thereâ€™s a good plot to do that!)

11. Did you find outliers?  Comment what you will do with them.

12. Check all columns for NaN values.  Decide what (if anything) you will need to do with them.

# Lab | Cleaning categorical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder. In this lab we will explore categorical data.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries if you are starting a new notebook.
Using the same data as the previous lab: we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv

2. Find  all of the categorical data.  Save it in a categorical_df variable.

3. Check for NaN values.

4. Check all unique values of columns.

5. Check dtypes. Do they all make sense as categorical data?

6. Does any column contain alpha and numeric data?  Decide how to clean it.

7. Would you choose to do anything else to clean or wrangle the categorical data?  Comment your decisions.

8. Compare policy_type and policy.  What information is contained in these columns.  Can you identify what is important?  

9. Check number of unique values in each column, can they be combined in any way to ease encoding?  Comment your thoughts and make those changes.


# Lab | Feature extraction

For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs. 

### Instructions

1. Open the `categoricals` variable we created before.

```python
categoricals = data.select_dtypes(np.object)
categoricals.head()
```

2. Plot all the categorical variables with the proper plot. What can you see?
3. There might be some columns that seem to be redundant, check their values to be sure. What should we do with them?
4. Plot time variable. Can you extract something from it?

# Lab | Comparing regression models


For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs. 

### Instructions

1. In this final lab, we will model our data. Import sklearn `train_test_split` and separate the data.

2. We will start with removing outliers, if you have not already done so.  We have discussed different methods to remove outliers. Use the one you feel more comfortable with, define a function for that. Use the function to remove the outliers and apply it to the dataframe.

3. Create a copy of the dataframe for the data wrangling.

4. Normalize the continuous variables. You can use any one method you want.

5. Encode the categorical variables (See the hint below for encoding categorical data!!!)

6. The time variable can be useful. Try to transform its data into a useful one. Hint: Day week and month as integers might be useful.

7. Since the model will only accept numerical data, check and make sure that every column is numerical, if some are not, change it using encoding.


## Hint for Categorical Variables

You should deal with the categorical variables as shown below (for ordinal encoding, dummy code has been provided as well):
Encoder Type | Column 
-----------------|-----------------
One hot | state
Ordinal | coverage
Ordinal | employmentstatus
Ordinal | location code
One hot | marital status
One hot | policy type
One hot | policy
One hot | renew offercustomer_df
One hot | sales channel
One hot | vehicle class
Ordinal | vehicle size

##### Dummy code
data["coverage"] = data["coverage"].map({"Basic" : 0, "Extended" : 1, "Premium" : 2})

given that column "coverage" in the dataframe "data" has three categories:

"basic", "extended", and "premium" and values are to be represented in the same order.



8. Try a simple linear regression with all the data to see whether we are getting good results.

9. Great! Now define a function that takes a list of models and train (and tests) them so we can try a lot of them without repeating code.

10. Use the function to check `LinearRegressor` and `KNeighborsRegressor`.

11. You can check also the `MLPRegressor` for this task!

12. Check and discuss the results.
